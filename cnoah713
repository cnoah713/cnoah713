# Data Analyst | Data Science Enthusiast | Ecological Data Specialist
## About Me
My name is Chris Chapman and I am a dedicated and results-driven Data Analyst with a strong passion for leveraging data to gain insights and make informed decisions. My journey in data analysis began during my four-year tenure at college,
where I extensively studied data analysis using tools such as Excel and R for coursework. During this time, I gained valuable experience in handling and analyzing large volumes of ecological data,
developing a deep understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques.

## Transition to Data from Pre-Med
After initially pursuing a pre-medical track, my fascination with the power of data and its potential to drive meaningful impact led me to transition my career aspirations towards working more extensively
with data. Recognizing the importance of a solid foundation in computer science and data science, I completed CS50, a renowned course offered by Harvard University, which provided me with a comprehensive 
understanding of computer science fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

## Data Science Certifications
To further enhance my skills and knowledge in data science, I embarked on a journey of continuous learning and upskilling. I successfully completed the IBM Data Science Certification,
where I gained hands-on experience in various data science techniques and tools. Additionally, I obtained the Data Analysis Certification from FreeCodeCamp, solidifying my proficiency in data analysis
methodologies and practices. I further expanded my expertise in statistical analysis by completing the University of Michigan's Statistics with Python Certification.

## Professional Experience
In my professional career, I have been working in the pharmaceutical industry, specializing in analyzing large amounts of UV-Vis data for bulk HRP-conjugated antibody batches.
Leveraging my strong analytical skills, I have been instrumental in extracting insights from complex datasets, ensuring quality control, and optimizing batch manufacturing processes. 
Through my work, I have developed a keen eye for detail, the ability to interpret data patterns, and a commitment to delivering accurate and actionable results.
